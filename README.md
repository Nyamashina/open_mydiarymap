samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Using Google Maps API in Your Flutter Project
This guide explains how to enable and use the Google Maps API for both iOS and Android platforms in your Flutter application. Follow these instructions to correctly configure the API keys and ensure the app functions properly on both platforms.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have a valid Google Cloud account and have access to the Google Cloud Console. You will need to create API keys for Google Maps services.

Setting Up Google Maps API
Enable the APIs:

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Create a new project or select an existing one.
Navigate to "API & Services > Library".
Search for and enable "Maps SDK for Android" and "Maps SDK for iOS".
Generate API Keys:

In the Google Cloud Console, go to "Credentials" and click on "Create Credentials > API key".
You will obtain two API keys. One for Android and another for iOS. You can restrict each key to its respective platform for enhanced security.
Configuring Your Flutter Project
Android Setup:

Open your Android manifest file located at android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml.
Add the following line within the <application> tag:
xml
Copy code
<meta-data
  android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
  android:value="YOUR_ANDROID_API_KEY"/>
Replace YOUR_ANDROID_API_KEY with the key generated for Android.
iOS Setup:

Open the AppDelegate.swift file in your iOS project located at ios/Runner.
Import GoogleMaps at the top of the file if not already present:
swift
Copy code
import GoogleMaps
Add the following line in the application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) method:
swift
Copy code
GMSServices.provideAPIKey("YOUR_IOS_API_KEY")
Replace YOUR_IOS_API_KEY with the key generated for iOS.
Final Steps
After setting up the API keys in your project, compile and run your application on both Android and iOS devices to see Google Maps in action. Make sure to test the functionality thoroughly to confirm that everything is set up correctly.

By following these steps, you integrate Google Maps into your Flutter application effectively, enabling a rich, interactive map experience on both major mobile platforms.
